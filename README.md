# stock-price-prediction-system
Stock price prediction is a challenging yet intriguing area of finance, where machine learning models are employed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. Accurate predictions can provide valuable insights for investors and traders, helping them make informed decisions.

In this project, we utilize a variety of machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The model is trained using the historical stock data of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) (2010 - 2017) and then tested on the stock data of Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) (2019 - 2024) . The goal is to evaluate how well the model generalizes to different stocks.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess historical stock data to make it suitable for model training.

Building Model: the predictive model is built using LSTM.

Model Training: Train the predictive model using Tesla stock data.

Model Testing: Evaluate the model's performance on Nvidia stock data.

Visualization: Generate plots to visualize stock trends, model predictions, and performance metrics.

Jupyter Notebook: The entire workflow, from data loading to model evaluation, is organized within a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and experimentation.

Required Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

keras

tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip
